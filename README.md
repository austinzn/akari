# Akari AKA Light Up

#### WARNING: Requires JAVAFX
### Game Description/Rules:
Light up is a game played on a rectangular grid comprising of black and white cells.
The aim of the game is to place light bulbs on the grid so that every white square is lit.
A call is considered lit if it lies in the same row or column as a light bulb, with no black
cells obstructing the path. Additionally, no light bulb may illuminate another light bulb.
Some of the black cells have numbers in them - A number in a black cell indicates how many light bulbs share an edge with that cell.
